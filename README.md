Motivation:
In today's world, focus groups, consumer panels, and surveys are no longer the most efficient way for companies
to gauge their customers' opinions and thoughts about their brand. Whether it is to influence product design,
branding strategy, identify trends, or stay on top of potential PR crises, "listening in" on social media is a must.
Automating a pipeline to retrieve and analyze this data, and using machine learning to mine actionable insights from
social media can allow corporate strategy to be based on data and direct customer feedback.

Challenge:
Despite the above benefits, social media data is very messy and contains a lot of noise that can obstruct the most important
insights. In this notebook, I will show how to succesfully use NLP techniques to extract these useful insights from Twitter data,
using the use case of the coffee industry and the Starbucks brand.

Dataset:

I am using a dataset scraped from Twitter (using Twint) for tweets between March 25 - April 25 2020 that contain the keywords
'Starbucks' and/or 'Coffee'. During this time, a very popular coffee trend emerged on Tik Tok, known as Dalgona Coffee
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalgona_coffee). A succesful analysis using the data sample for this time should identify
this as a coffee trend that Starbucks did not take advantage of.
